# AI Handoff: Stable Working Model (2024-07-25)

## 1. Current Status

This document marks a stable, working version of the Generative Dialogue application. All major UI bugs and WebSocket connection issues have been resolved. The application is in a good state for further development or production testing.

**Key Achievements:**
- **UI:** All UI elements, including icons and hero banners, are rendering correctly. The handcrafted UI has been preserved.
- **Backend:** The WebSocket connection is now stable and includes a robust reconnection mechanism. The infinite loop on the client-side has been fixed.
- **Servers:** The frontend is running on `http://localhost:3100`, and the backend is on `http://localhost:8080`.

## 2. How to Get to This State

If the application breaks in the future, you can return to this stable state by following these steps:

**From GitHub:**
1.  **Fetch all branches:** `git fetch --all`
2.  **Check out the stable branch:** `git checkout stable-working-model`
3.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install --prefix client && npm install --prefix backend`
4.  **Start the servers:**
    *   **Backend:** `npm start --prefix backend`
    *   **Frontend:** `PORT=3100 npm start --prefix client`

**From Local Backup:**
- Use the `create-stable-backup.sh` script to create a local `tar.gz` backup.
- To restore, simply extract the backup to a new directory.

## 3. Key Files and Logic

- **`client/src/components/BottomContentArea.js`**: This is the core of the frontend's real-time functionality. The WebSocket connection is managed here. The infinite loop was fixed by removing a `useEffect` that was incorrectly triggering reconnection attempts.
- **`backend/server.js`**: This file contains the backend server logic, including the WebSocket server. A reconnection mechanism with exponential backoff was added to the Deepgram WebSocket connection to improve stability.
- **UI Components:** Several UI components were fixed (`FooterNavigation.js`, `LandingPage.js`, `PermissionSetup.js`, `PermissionSetup.css`), but the key takeaway is that the handcrafted UI should not be refactored without explicit instructions.

## 4. Next Steps

With a stable base to work from, the project is ready for the next phase of development. Future work can now focus on new features and enhancements, rather than bug fixes.
