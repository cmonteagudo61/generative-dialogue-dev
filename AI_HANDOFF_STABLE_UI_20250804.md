# AI Handoff Document: Stable UI Milestone

**Date:** August 4, 2025
**Branch:** `stable-working-model`
**Commit:** `4a6430e`

## Summary of Work Completed

The primary objective of this session was to diagnose and resolve a persistent UI styling issue that caused inconsistent button appearances across different pages, most notably an erroneous "orange circle" on navigation buttons. After several incorrect diagnoses, the root cause was identified as redundant and conflicting CSS rules in component-specific stylesheets.

The following actions were taken to fix the issue and establish a stable UI baseline:

1.  **Centralized Footer Navigation:** All footer and navigation button styles were consolidated into the `FooterNavigation.js` component and its corresponding stylesheet, `FooterNavigation.css`.
2.  **Removed Redundant CSS:** Conflicting style definitions for `.control-bar` and `.control-button` were removed from `LandingPage.css`, `InputPage.css`, and `PermissionSetup.css`.
3.  **Unified Imports:** All components (`LandingPage.js`, `InputPage.js`, `PermissionSetup.js`) now import and render the `FooterNavigation` component, ensuring a single source of truth for the UI.
4.  **Code Cleanup:** Corrected broken and unused icon imports across multiple components.

## Current Status

The application is in a stable, working state. The UI is now consistent across all pages, and the navigation controls function as expected without any visual defects.

## Project Backups

-   **Git:** All changes have been committed and pushed to the `stable-working-model` branch.
-   **Local Archive:** A full, self-contained backup of the project has been created at `generative-dialogue-dev-backup-20250804_145644.tar.gz`.

## Next Steps

The application is now at a stable milestone. The next development cycle can proceed from this known-good state. The immediate focus should be on implementing new features or addressing the next set of priorities.

**To restart the development environment:**
- Run `npm start` in the `backend` directory.
- Run `PORT=3100 npm start` in the `client` directory. [[memory:3832739]]
