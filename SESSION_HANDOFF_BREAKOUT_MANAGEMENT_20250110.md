## 🎯 **NEXT PRIORITIES (In Order)**

### **🔥 IMMEDIATE NEXT: Collective Wisdom Compilation**
**Goal:** Aggregate all breakout room summaries into emergent collective insights

**What to Build:**
1. **CollectiveWisdomCompiler.js** - Aggregates summaries across rooms
2. **WisdomSynthesis.js** - AI-powered synthesis of collective insights
3. **WETabIntegration.js** - Integration with existing WE tab system
4. **EmergentThemes.js** - Pattern recognition across conversations

**Key Features Needed:**
- Cross-room summary aggregation
- Theme pattern recognition
- Collective insight generation
- WE tab data integration
- Export capabilities for harvest stage

### **🌟 SECONDARY PRIORITIES:**

**Harvest Stage Enhancement:**
- 10 reflection questions system
- Individual reflection capture
- Personal insight compilation
- Journey summary generation

**Video Integration Preparation:**
- Daily.co integration points
- Room assignment coordination
- Video/audio state management
- Participant video grid layouts

**Advanced AI Features:**
- Real-time conversation analysis
- Sentiment tracking across rooms
- Engagement metrics
- Conversation quality indicators

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **State Management Pattern:**
```javascript
// Multi-room state coordination
const [roomTranscripts, setRoomTranscripts] = useState({});
const [roomSummaries, setRoomSummaries] = useState({});
const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState({});

// Persistent storage integration
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('breakout_transcripts', JSON.stringify(roomTranscripts));
}, [roomTranscripts]);
```

### **Component Architecture:**
```
SessionOrchestrator
└── BreakoutRoomManager
    ├── RoomOverview (grid view)
    ├── RoomDetailView (individual room)
    ├── TranscriptOverview (all transcripts)
    ├── SummaryDisplay (AI summaries)
    └── ParticipantRoomView (participant experience)
```

### **Integration Points:**
- **DialogueManager**: Live session launcher
- **SessionOrchestrator**: Core session state management
- **BreakoutRoomManager**: Room-specific functionality
- **Future CollectiveWisdomCompiler**: Summary aggregation

---

## 🐛 **KNOWN ISSUES & CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Current Limitations:**
1. **Mock Data**: Using simulated conversations (ready for real integration)
2. **AI Summaries**: Mock generation (API integration points prepared)
3. **Video Integration**: Placeholders ready for Daily.co integration
4. **Real-time Sync**: localStorage-based (ready for WebSocket upgrade)

### **Performance Considerations:**
- Transcript storage grows with conversation length
- Summary generation scales with room count
- UI remains responsive with proper React optimization
- Memory usage managed with cleanup functions

### **Security & Privacy:**
