### **Expected Results:**
- **Carlos + Test2** should see each other in dyad room 1
- **Ruth + Test1** should see each other in dyad room 2
- **Perfect video feeds** with correct participant names
- **Dyad layout** (2 video tiles side by side)

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SUCCESS INDICATORS:**

### ✅ **Debug Logs to Watch For:**
```
🚨 ATTEMPTING TO JOIN ROOM: {participantName: 'Carlos', roomUrl: '...'}
🚨 PARTICIPANT JOINED ROOM: {participantName: 'Test2', ...}
🔍 VideoProvider: Total participants in room: 2
🎯 GenerativeDialogue: Using dyad layout for dyad room
```

### ✅ **UI Elements to Verify:**
- Green "Your Room Assignment" section in host dashboard

- **Participant experience** (auto-join, clean UI)
