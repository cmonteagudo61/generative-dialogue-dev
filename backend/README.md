# Speech Recognition Proof of Concept

## 🎯 Goal
Test Deepgram speech recognition in complete isolation from the main application.

## ✅ Safety
This test environment is completely separate from your working UI and won't affect it in any way.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Test API Connectivity
```bash
npm install
npm test
```

This will:
- ✅ Test Deepgram API connectivity
- ✅ Generate test audio
- ✅ Verify transcription works
- ✅ Confirm everything is ready

### Step 2: Test Web Interface
```bash
npm start
```

Then open: http://localhost:8080

## 📋 Tests Available

1. **Browser Speech Recognition** - Test the built-in browser speech API (working fallback)
2. **Deepgram Recording** - Test audio recording (simulation for now)
3. **Deepgram File Upload** - Test with audio files (simulation for now)

## 🔧 What This Proves

- ✅ Deepgram API credentials work
- ✅ Audio recording works in browser
- ✅ Integration patterns are established
- ✅ Foundation for full implementation

## 📝 Next Steps

Once this proof of concept works:
1. Integrate into main app gradually
2. Add real-time features
3. Use proven stability patterns

## 🛡️ Safe Development

This approach protects your working UI while we build and test speech features incrementally.
